# An Ecommerce web site

## Project description

This eCommerce webpage, crafted with HTML and CSS, delivers a seamless user experience. Explore product listings, navigate an intuitive contact page, and discover more about the store on the about page. With a clean and responsive design, this project showcases fundamental web development skills, offering a glimpse into the intersection of aesthetics and functionality in digital commerce.

## Challanges faced:

The primary challenge encountered in this project was establishing seamless navigation between the three main pagesâ€”home, contact, and about. Overcoming this obstacle involved gaining a deeper understanding of HTML hyperlinks and ensuring proper file structuring for interconnected pages. Through this experience, I strengthened my skills in linking and connecting pages within a website, contributing to a more cohesive user experience.
